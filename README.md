# react-redux-wiki

This is a simple single-page web app that gets summaries to Wikipedia articles using the [WikiMedia REST API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/REST_API). It uses [React](https://reactjs.org) for rendering and [Redux](https://redux.js.org) as a state container, as well as the [redux-thunk middleware](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk) to allow for calling REST APIs through Redux. This was a simple project I threw together in a few hours to get the hang of using Redux.
